## Amir Ben Abbes

I design and build security-oriented infrastructure and cloud-native systems, with a focus on correctness, observability, and failure resistance.

I am particularly interested in systems where silent failure is unacceptable: log pipelines, control planes, and security-critical infrastructure.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- Software architecture
- Distributed systems with integrity guarantees
- Cloud observability (metrics, logs, traces)
- DevSecOps and Kubernetes security
