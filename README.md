## Amir Ben Abbes

I design and build security-oriented infrastructure and cloud-native systems, with a focus on correctness, observability, and failure resistance.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- Distributed systems with integrity guarantees
- Cloud observability (metrics, logs, traces)
- DevSecOps and Kubernetes security

### Selected projects
- **Secure Distributed Log Aggregator**  
  A tamper-evident log aggregation system written in Rust.  
  Logs are batched, cryptographically signed, hash-chained, and stored in an append-only structure to detect silent deletion, reordering, or forgery in distributed environments.

- **Cloud-native observability stack**  
  End-to-end observability on Amazon EKS using Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Tempo, and OpenTelemetry, designed to monitor, trace, and debug cloud-native workloads under real operational constraints.

- **DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline**  
  A secure CI/CD pipeline with automated vulnerability scanning, Kubernetes deployment, and runtime observability, integrating security checks directly into the delivery process.

- **Kubernetes security tooling**  
  Static analysis and attack simulation tools for identifying common misconfigurations and security weaknesses in Kubernetes manifests and clusters.
