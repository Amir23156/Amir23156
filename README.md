## Amir Ben Abbes

I design and build security-oriented infrastructure and cloud-native systems, with a focus on correctness, observability, and failure resistance.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- Software Architecture
- Distributed systems with integrity guarantees
- Cloud observability (metrics, logs, traces)
- DevSecOps and Kubernetes security
